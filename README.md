#Ping Pong solo Assignment

  This was a challenge at using, not only the things we have learned the previous weeks. It also incorporated Loops and Arrays into the mix. I chose to use the "for" loop command, seeting my variables in the user logic section to "numbers" and "final". I used pingpong as the function.
  The if/else statements setting if the numbers in the array were divisible by 3, 5, or 15 that the numbers.push would insert those in the array. Then the result=numbers.join(", ") put them all in a neat line with the comma and space in between. the return command = restult called it.
  As for the business logic side, it was all Jquery. I learned a new command from W3schools .empty brings up a whole new array when a new number is entered.
